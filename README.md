[00:26.64] I've been defeated and brought down
[00:35.04] Dropped to my knees when hope ran out
[00:43.94] The time has come to change my ways
[01:01.44] 
[00:55.98] On this day I see clearly
[01:00.34] Everything has come to life
[01:04.71] A bitter place and a broken dream
[01:08.97] And we'll leave it all, leave it all behind
[01:30.47] 
[01:23.32] I'll never long for what might have been
[01:30.62] And now regret won't waste my life again
[01:40.64] I won't look back, I'll fight to remain
[02:00.14] 
[01:52.46] On this day I see clearly
[01:56.87] Everything has come to life
[02:01.29] A bitter place and a broken dream
[02:05.68] And we'll leave it all behind
[02:10.02] On this day, it's so real to me
[02:14.42] Everything has come to life
[02:18.78] Another chance to chase a dream
[02:23.18] Another chance to feel, chance to feel alive
[02:45.18] 
[02:46.10] Fear will kill me, all I could be
[02:54.60] Lift these sorrows, let me breathe
[03:03.46] Could you set me free?
[03:12.13] Could you set me free?
[03:23.13] 
[03:21.36] On this day I see clearly
[03:25.62] Everything has come to life
[03:30.05] A bitter place and a broken dream
[03:34.35] And we'll leave it all behind
[03:38.78] On this day, it's so real to me
[03:43.17] Everything has come to life
[03:47.46] Another chance to chase a dream
[03:51.77] Another chance to feel, chance to feel alive
